Prompts that scroll. Using ink. üéâ

`ink-scroll-prompts` enables you to display and interact with strings of large or unknown length. It was build to implement a REPL that could suggest code snippets mined from NPM package documentation. It's an alternative to existing prompt packages, or full screen curses apps which use the alternate screen buffer. `ink-scroll-prompts` preserves the terminal history for more traditional command line interfaces.
